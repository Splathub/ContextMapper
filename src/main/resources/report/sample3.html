Treatment</span><span>&para;<br>&para;<br>You should review carefully the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the accompanying product </span><span>supplement no. 4-II. </span><span>In determining our reporting responsibilities we intend to treat (i) the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as </span><span>prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Interest Payments as ordinary income, as </span><span>described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences — Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders — Notes </span><span>Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying product supplement. </span><span>Based on the </span><span>advice of Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP, our special tax counsel, we believe that this is a reasonable treatment, but that there are other </span><span>reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes </span><span>could be materially affected.</span><span> In addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal </span><span>income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. </span><span>The notice focuses in particular on whether to require </span><span>investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment.</span><span> It also asks for comments on a number of related </span><span>topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the </span><span>underlying property to which the instruments are linked.</span><span> While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and </span><span>effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the </span><span>tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. </span><span>The discussions above and in the accompanying </span><span>product supplement do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the </span><span>Code.</span><span> You should consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, </span><span>including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the notice described above.</span><span>&para;<br>Non-U.S. Holders — Tax Considerations.</span><span> The U.S. federal income tax treatment of Contingent Interest Payments is uncertain, and </span><span>although we believe it is reasonable to take a position that Contingent Interest Payments are not subject to U.S. withholding tax (at least </span><span>if an applicable Form W-8 is provided), a withholding agent may nonetheless withhold on these payments (generally at a rate of 30%, </span><span>subject to the possible reduction of that rate under an applicable income tax treaty), unless income from your notes is effectively</span><span>&para;<br>connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if an applicable treaty so requires, attributable to a </span><span>permanent establishment in the United States).</span><span> If you are not a United States person, you are urged to consult your tax adviser </span><span>regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes in light of your particular circumstances.</span><span>&para;<br>Section 871(m) of the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Section 871(m)”) generally impose a 30% withholding </span><span>tax (unless an income tax treaty applies) on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain </span><span>financial instruments linked to U.S. equities or indices that include U.S. equities. </span><span>Section 871(m) provides certain exceptions to this </span><span>withholding regime, including for instruments linked to certain broad-based indices that meet requirements set forth in the applicable </span><span>Treasury regulations. </span><span>Additionally, a recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January </span><span>1, 2023 that do not have a delta of one with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal </span><span>income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”).</span><span> Based on certain determinations made by us, we expect that Section 871(m) will </span><span>not apply to the notes with regard to Non-U.S. Holders.</span><span> Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with </span><span>this determination.</span><span> Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you </span><span>enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security.</span><span> If necessary, further information regarding the potential application </span><span>of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the notes.</span><span> You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential </span><span>application of Section 871(m) to the notes.</span><span>&para;<br>In the event of any withholding on the notes, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.</span><span class='appended'>&para;<br></span><span>&para;<br>&para;<br>The Estimated Value of the Notes</span><span>&para;<br>&para;<br>The estimated value of the

value of the </span><span>notes does not represent a minimum price at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at </span><span>any time.</span><span> The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied </span><span>funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. or its affiliates. </span><span>Any difference </span><span>may be based on, among other things, our and our affiliates’ view of the funding value of the

intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. </span><span>The use of an internal </span><span>funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an

supplement.</span><span>&para;<br>The value of the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our </span><span>affiliates.</span><span> These models are dependent on inputs such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on </span><span>various other inputs, some of which are market-observable, and which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other </span><span>factors, as well as assumptions about future market events and/or environments.

and other relevant factors in the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. </span><span>On </span><span>future dates, the value of the notes could change significantly based

if any, at </span><span>which JPMS would be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions.</span><span>&para;<br>The estimated value of the notes will be lower than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling, </span><span>structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. </span><span>These costs include the

inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. </span><span>Because </span><span>hedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that </span><span>is more or less than expected, or it may result in a loss.</span><span> A portion of the profits, if any, realized in hedging our obligations under the </span><span>notes may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging </span><span>profits.</span><span> See “Selected Risk Considerations — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes — The </span><span>Estimated Value of the
